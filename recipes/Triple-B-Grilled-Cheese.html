<body>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is my favourite type of grilled cheese. It has everyhting, bread, cheese, protein, and veggies!
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be done with any cheese really but I call it the Tripple B because it is Bacon, Blue Cheese, and Broccolie. I do believe that Blue-cheese adds
         best flavor for this recipes. So if possible I would stick with it.
